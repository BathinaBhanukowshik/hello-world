Hi everyone!
My name is Bhanukowshik Bathina, a student at Concordia University pursuing a master's in computer science, and I'm really excited to be in this class with all of you. A little about me: I'm from India, and I enjoy sports, music, gaming, and more. I'm looking forward to learning together, making new friends, and having a great time this year.
